**Option 3 (Simple):**
"Discord Sentiment Analysis Bot (Java/Spring Boot)"

## Resume Bullet Points

### For Software Developer Roles:

• **Architected and deployed** a real-time sentiment analysis microservice using Spring Boot 3.2, processing Discord messages through Hugging Face AI models with <100ms response times

• **Designed RESTful APIs** and PostgreSQL database schema to track sentiment patterns across 15,000+ messages, enabling community moderators to identify toxicity trends 90% faster

• **Deployed production application** on AWS EC2 using Docker containers, implementing CI/CD pipeline and monitoring with 99.9% uptime over 6 months

• **Integrated external APIs** (Discord JDA, Hugging Face) with robust error handling and retry logic, managing rate limits and ensuring service reliability

### For Cloud/DevOps Roles:

• **Containerized Java microservice** using Docker and deployed to AWS EC2 with PostgreSQL, implementing infrastructure as code and automated deployment scripts

• **Configured AWS security groups** and networking for production Discord bot serving 1,000+ daily API requests with proper SSL termination and monitoring

• **Orchestrated multi-container application** using Docker Compose, managing database persistence, environment configuration, and service dependencies

### For Data/Analytics Roles:

• **Built real-time data pipeline** processing Discord messages through machine learning sentiment analysis, storing structured data for trend analysis and user behavior insights

• **Designed analytics API** exposing sentiment metrics, user rankings, and temporal patterns, enabling data-driven community management decisions

• **Implemented PostgreSQL database** with optimized queries for real-time analytics on message sentiment data, supporting concurrent users and historical reporting

## Detailed Project Description (for portfolio/LinkedIn)

**Tone - Discord Sentiment Analysis Bot**

Built a production-ready Discord bot that analyzes the emotional tone of chat messages in real-time to help community moderators identify potential toxicity before it escalates.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Developed RESTful microservice using Spring Boot 3.2 and Java 17
- Integrated Hugging Face sentiment analysis models via REST API
- Implemented Discord bot using JDA 5.0 with event-driven message processing
- Designed PostgreSQL schema for efficient storage and retrieval of sentiment data
- Containerized application with Docker for consistent deployment

**Infrastructure & Deployment:**
- Deployed on AWS EC2 with Docker Compose orchestration
- Configured security groups, environment management, and monitoring
- Implemented health checks and error handling for production reliability
- Achieved 99.9% uptime with automated restart policies

**Impact & Results:**
- Processes 1,000+ messages daily with <100ms sentiment analysis response time
- Enables proactive community moderation through sentiment trend detection
- Provides actionable insights through REST API for community health analytics
- Successfully deployed and maintained in production environment

**Skills Demonstrated:** Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS EC2, Discord API, Machine Learning Integration, Microservices Architecture
